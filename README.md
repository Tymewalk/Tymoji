# Tymoji
Tymewalk's Emojis for use on the Scratch forums. All in one handy userscript.

## Why use Tymoji?
Many Scratchers want to have more smilies and emojis on the Scratch Forums. But since there are far more pressing issues (such as security), emojis are very low on the list of things that need to be added.

Enter Tymoji. Tymoji allows you to insert emojis in the Scratch forums as simple as typing `~smile~`.

When you type `~smile~`, it gets auto-replaced with a Tymoji smile. Neat, huh?

### How to make versions
For releases, use the normal versioning scheme (0.1, 0.1.1, 0.2, etc.)

For dev builds, use this versioning scheme:

    0.1-dev001

`0.1` is the release being worked on. For example, if you released 0.1 yesterday, it would be `0.2-devXXX`.

`-dev001` is which dev build this is. Increase it every commit that changes code. This way, users can easily see how many commits behind they are.
