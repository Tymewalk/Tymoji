# Tymoji
Tymewalk's Emojis for use on the Scratch forums. All in one handy userscript.

## Why use Tymoji?
Emojis on the Scratch forums are limited. What with the ever-growing number of emojis on our devices, many Scratchers want to be able to use them! The only problem is that the Scratch Team can't keep up with the rapidly-expanding Unicode emojibase.

Enter Tymoji. Tymoji allows you to insert emojis in the Scratch forums as simple as typing `:smile:`.

`:smile:` gets auto-replaced with a Tymoji smile. Neat, huh?

## List of emojis

    :smile: - Smiling Face
    :frown: - Frowning Face
    :elims: - Upside-Down Smiling Face
    :nomouth: - Face with no mouth
